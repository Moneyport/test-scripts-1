Feature: Test participant endpoint for adding a participant (POST /participant) to the switch.

  Scenario Outline: Test POST /participants for participant type MSISDN.
    When  I send a request to POST /participants with Type "<Type>" ID "<ID>" and  "<FspID>" with  "<Currency>"
    Then the participant information should be added in the switch. Expected FspID in the response is "<ExpectedFspID>"

    Examples:
      |  Type   |     ID     |    FspID    |  Currency  |  ExpectedFspID   |
      | MSISDN  | 1272545111 |   payerfsp  |    USD     |     payerfsp     |
      | MSISDN  | 1272545117 |   payeefsp  |    USD     |     payeefsp     |


  Scenario Outline: Test POST /participants for participant type MSISDN  without passing in optional currency, should not fail the request
    When  I send a request to POST /participants with Type is "<Type>", ID is "<ID>" and FspID "<FspID>" and do not pass "<Currency>" in the request
    Then the participant information should be added in the switch without currency. Expected FspID in the response is "<ExpectedFspID>"
    Examples:
      |   Type    |    ID    |    FspID    |  Currency  |   ExpectedFspID  |
      |  MSISDN   |1272545111 |   payerfsp  |            |     payerfsp     |
      |  MSISDN   |1272545117 |   payeefsp  |            |     payeefsp     |

  Scenario Outline: Test POST /participant when try to add a participant that already exist in switch, should throw a message
    Given a participant with MSISDN "<ID>" exists in switch with a "<FspID>"
    When I add the participant with the same "<Type>" , "<ID>" and "<FspID>" to the switch
    Then I should get a response "<Message>"

    Examples:
      |   Type   |     ID     |    FspID   |      Message    |
      |  MSISDN  | 1272545111 |  payerfsp  | User already exists |

  Scenario Outline: Test POST /participants for missing any of the required fields, should fail the request
    When  I send a request to POST /participants with "<Type>" and one of these fileds missing "<ID>" "<FspID>" in the request
    Then An error should be returned. Expected error code is "<ExpectedErrorCode>"
    And error description is "<ExpectedErrorDescription>"

    Examples:
      |    Type   |     ID     |   FspID   | ExpectedResponseCode |  ExpectedErrorCode  |             ExpectedErrorDescription            |
      |   MSISDN  |            |  payerfsp |         404          |        3102         | Mandatory eliment in  the data model was missing|
      |   MSISDN  | 1272545117 |           |         404          |        3102         | Mandatory eliment in the datta model was missing|
